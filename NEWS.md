# AzureRMR 2.0.9000

* This version adds basic support for role-based access control (RBAC) at subscription, resource group and resource level. Add and remove role assignments, and retrieve role definitions. See `?rbac` for more information.

# AzureRMR 2.0.0

## Significant interface changes

* New `create_azure_login`, `get_azure_login` and `delete_azure_login` functions to handle ARM authentication. By default, these will authenticate using your AAD user credentials without requiring you to create a service principal. Directly calling `az_rm$new()` will still work, but it's recommended to use `create_azure_login` and `get_azure_login` going forward. Login credentials will be saved and reused for subsequent sessions (see below).
* Token acquisition logic substantially enhanced and moved to a new package, [AzureAuth](https://github.com/cloudyr/AzureAuth). `get_azure_token` now supports four authentication methods for obtaining tokens (`client_credentials`, `authorization_code`, `device_code` and `resource_owner`). Tokens are also automatically cached and retrieved for use in subsequent sessions, without needing the user to reauthenticate. See the AzureAuth documentation for more details.

## Other changes

* Don't print empty fields for ARM objects.
* Add optional `etag` field to resource object definition.
* Add `location` argument to `az_resource_group$create_resource` method, rather than hardcoding it to the resgroup location.
* Add `wait` argument when creating a new resource, similar to deploying a template, since some resources will return before provisioning is complete. Defaults to `FALSE` for backward compatibility.
* Export `is_azure_token`.
* Allow `az_resource_group$deploy_template()` to work without `parameters` arg (parameters folded into template itself).
* Fix a bug that kept `az_resource_group$delete_resource` from deleting the resource.
* New resource method `az_resource$get_api_version` to match `set_api_version`.
* By default, use the latest _stable_ API version when interacting with resources. `az_resource$set_api_version` gains a new argument `stable_only` which defaults to `TRUE`; set this to `FALSE` if you want the latest preview version.
* `az_resource$sync_fields()` will respect a non-default API version.
* Add management lock functionality for subscriptions, resource groups and resources. Call `create_lock` to create a lock, `get_lock` to retrieve an existing lock object, and `delete_lock` to delete a lock. Call `list_locks` to list all the locks that apply to an object.
* Add tagging functionality for resource groups, similar to that for resources. Call `set_tags` to set tags, and `get_tags` to retrieve them.
* Allow `named_list` to accept empty inputs. The output will be a list of length 0 with a `names` attribute.
* Fix template deployment not to drop empty fields (related to #13).
